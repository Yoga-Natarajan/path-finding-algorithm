Djikstra's algorithm visualized

Used Pygame for a visual representation for Djikstra's path-finding algorithm in the form of a simple, fun game. 
The computer attempts to get from a start point to an end point by using Djikstra's algorithm. The user's aim 
is to create obstructions to slow down the computer.
